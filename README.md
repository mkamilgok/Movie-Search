# Movie Search App

This web application provides movie searching and listing and it's implemented with React. [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/) is used in order to fetch data. 

By implementhing this project, I practiced:
- Container-Presentational Components Programming Pattern
- Setting the State of Components by using Hooks
- Interacting with The Movie Database API

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


## Usage

You can search movies by entering the name and view the list of movies with their explanations.
